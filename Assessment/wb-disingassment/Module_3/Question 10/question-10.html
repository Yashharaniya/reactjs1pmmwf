<!-- QUESTION:
        HOW CAN WE CLUB TWO OR MORE ROWS OR COLUMNS INTO A SINGLE ROW OR COLUMN IN AN HTML TABLE? WITH EXAMPLE.
    
    ANSWER:
        In an HTML table, the colspan and rowspan attributes must be used to combine several rows or columns into a single row or column. The rowspan attribute is used to combine rows, while the colspan attribute is used to determine how many columns should be combined in a cell.

        <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th></th>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td rowspan="2"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        </table>

    this is the code for rowspan attribute.
    
    <table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2"></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    this is the code for colspan attribute.
