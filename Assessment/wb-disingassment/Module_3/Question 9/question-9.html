<!-- HOW IS CELL PADDING DIFFERENT FROM CELL SPACING? WITH EXAMPLE.
    html tables can adjust with the padding and spacing.
    cell padding and cell spacing is playing different roles. cell padding is used for providing space in cell content within cell edge, while cellspacing used for making space between each cells.

    for example:
    th, td {
        padding-top: 10px;
        padding-bottom: 20px;
        padding-left: 30px;
        padding-right: 40px;
      } -->
